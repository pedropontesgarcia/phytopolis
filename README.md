# Phytopolis

Sow seeds of hope in a city of shadows by cultivating and climbing a sprout as it grows into a mighty ivy! Ascend and defend a flourishing plant against the dangers of a careless society until it reaches a clear sky beyond the rooftops of a polluted metropolis, leaving behind a lush legacy of green.

## Getting Started

- **Movement:** Use `A` and `D` to move horizontally, `W` to jump, and `S` to fall through leaves.
- **Growing:** Click over branch previews to build branches, hold left shift and click over leaf previews to build or upgrade leaves.
- **Resource management:** Growing and upgrading branches and leaves requires water, collected by colliding with water drops.
- **Sunlight:** Collect sunlight falling from the sky by positioning leaves to add time to the timer.
- **Challenges:** Extinguish fire by clicking on it, consuming some water, and stomp on bugs to eliminate them.
- **Navigation:** Scroll through levels with mouse scroll, snap camera back to the player by pressing any movement key.
- **Customization:** Adjust controls, graphics, and sound options in the menus.

## Roadmap

- **Level design:** Finalize remaining levels to complete the game's progression.
- **Sound effects:** Include more audio effects to enhance gameplay experience.
- **Visual improvements:** Introduce a more varied tile set and enhance visual feedback for player and environment interactions.
- **Tutorial:** Implement tutorial cues in the initial levels to guide players.
- **Additional features:** Incorporate bug nests and decay zones for added complexity and challenge.
